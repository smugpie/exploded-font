# Exploded font

An experiment to create a stereoscopic 3D font using blend modes in COLRv1.

View the scripts in the `scripts` folder to see each experiment in turn. (You need only run script 03 for the final effect.)

Dig out your red/blue 3D glasses and give it a go!

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 03colorAllGlyphsBlend.py
```

Output font is in the `build` folder.
